/** \brief Computes a plane orthogonal to the view for use with panning.
\details Mouse-based view panning requires the 3D point under the mouse pointer
to remain constant. Use computePanPlane() and pan() together to facilitate this
behavior.

The typical application-code use case is:
\li User depresses mouse button.
\li Application code responds by calling computePanPlane().
\li User drags mouse with button depressed.
\li For each drag event, application calls pan() and passes in both the pan plane
(obtained from computePanPlane()) and the delta NDC mouse motion. pan() returns
the literal delta amount corresponding to that motion. The application passes this
(negated) amount to MxCore::moveLiteral() to effect tha panning.

Call computePanPlane() at the start of the pan interaction to compute
a plane equation, then pass that plane equation to the pan() function while the
user pans (typically with mouse drag events).

computePanPlane() takes NDC x and y values as input, typically the mouse
location normalized to the range -1 to 1 in x and y. It back-projects this point
into world coordinates, then intersects with the \scene to obtain a world coordinate
pick point. (If the intersection fails, computePanPlane() uses a point 10 units in
front of the eye as the pick point.) The returned plane equation contains the pick
point, and has a normal obtained from mxCore->getDir() (the view direction
vector).

In order to back-prokect the NDC mouse coordnate \c ndcX and \c ndcY, the function
needs both the current view matrix and current projection matrix. The \c mxCore
projection member variables \c _aspect, \c _fovy, and \c _ortho must be configured
to return the projection matrix (see MxCore::computeProjection().

See pan() for information on how the \c panPlane pan plane equation is used during
panning.

\param scene Used for its bounding sphere (to obtain reasonable distance values during
back-projection). Also used for intersection testing to determine a pick point.
\param mxCore Used to obtain the cirrent view direction and view position. \c mxCore
must also be configured to return an appropriate projection matrix. 
\param ndcX Initial pan x location normalized to range -1 to 1.
\param ndcY Initial pan y location normalized to range -1 to 1.

/** \brief Computes world coordinate movement in the given pan plane.
\details This function computes literal xyz delta motion in the given \c panPlane. It does
this by back-projecting the given delta NDX coordinates onto \c panPlane, along with the
back-projection of the NDC origin onto that same plane. The returned value is the
difference between these two projected values.

pan() is designed to work with computePanPlane(). Application / device handling
code should call computePanPlane() at the start of a pan interaction in order to
obtain the \c panPlane plane equation. See computePanPlane() for more information.

\param scene Used only for its bounding sphere in order to obtain reasonable distance
values during back-projection.
\param mxCore As with computePanPlane(), \c mxCore must be configured to return an
appropriate projection matrix. pan() further uses \c mxCore to obtain the cirrent view
direction and view position.
\param panPlane plane equation, obtained from computePanPlane().
\param deltaNdcX Delta x movement normalized to range -1 to 1.
\param deltaNdcY Delta y movement normalized to range -1 to 1.

pass the negated return value to MxCore::moveLiteral().

/** \class FunctionalMap MxUtils.h <osgwMx/MxUtils.h>
\brief Maps an unsigned int to a particular function.

This class is presently used for arbitrary mapping of MxGamePad buttons,
where each bit is a single bit in a 32-bit unsigned int. In this usage,
the class supports the dot OSG file format, which means a FunctionalMap
can be read from or written to a .osg file as an osg::Object, thus providing
"config file" support for game pads.

The class can be used to map arbitrary unsigned int values (not bit values),
but currently this usage is not supported with the dot OSG file format.

The MxGamePad base class owns an instance of FunctionalMap, which can be
shared amongst game pad instances. The copy constructor is fully supported.

Applications can set the function mapping in two ways:
\li FunctionalMap::configure(), passing in a specific unsigned int \c key value
and a FunctionalMap::FunctionType.
\li Read the FunctionalMap osg::Object from a .osg file (and set it in the game
pas with a call to MxGamePad::setFunctionalMap()).

Future work:
\li Support non-bitfield keys in dot OSG.
\li Possible changes to support devices other than game pad (such as space
ball, kbd/mouse, etc).
