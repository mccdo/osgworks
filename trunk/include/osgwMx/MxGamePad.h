/** \class MxGamePad MxGamePad.h <osgwx/MxGamePad.h>
\brief A base class to support various GamePad SDKs.

To support a new SDK, such as VR Juggler, derive a class from MxGamePad.
Implement a function in your class to receive events (either handle events
sent from the SDK, or a function to poll the SDK device once per frame).
Call that function anything you want -- it's your class's specific function,
and the MxGamePad base class imposes no policy on its interface or how you
implement it.

In that event handling function, call into this base class as appropriate
in response to events or device state. Functions are provided for left stick
x and y axes, right stick x and y axes, and an unsigned int button mask.
The "DPad" (above the left stick on many game pads) is not currently supported.

This base class "has a" FunctionalMap that maps buttons to functions. See
setButtons() and setFunctionalMap(). This base class creates a default
FunctionalMap with a default button-to-function mapping. Derived classes don't
need to re-configure this mapping, but can if desired. The intention of this
design is that the owning application will load a config file for the functional
map that is specific to a particular game pad device and/or VR device SDK (such
as DirectX or VR Juggler):

\code
MxGamePad::setFunctionalMap( static_cast< FunctionalMap >(
        osgDB::readObjectFile( "my-gamepad-config.osg" ) ) );
\endcode

An example FunctionalMap config file is in data/default-gamepad.osg.

This base class "has a" instance of an MxCore object. Functions to set stick
positions and button state result in immediate calls into MxCore. The
MxCore object is fully exposed. An application can retrieve the MxCore
managed matrix as desired. Your MxGamePad- derived class can also call
directly into the \c _mxCore member variable, if necessary, to support
functionality unavailable in the MxGamePad base class.

    /** Set the left stick position.

    Left stick controls movement. setLeftStick(float,float) modifies the MxCore position based on the
    specified values once per function call. For example, calling setLeftStick( -1., 0. )
    twice in a row will move the MxCore position -2.0 in x.

    Left stick \c x axis moves the position left/right. With no buttons depressed, \c y
    axis moves the position forward/backward. If the BottomButton is depressed ("RGB"
    buttons in front of right stick), then left stick \c y axis moves the position up
    and down. Negative values move left, backward, and down, while positive values move
    right, forward, and up.

    Movement is scaled by the right shoulder buttons. RightShoulderBottom decreases speed
    to 0.33x, and RightShoulderTop increases speed to 3x. Movement is further scaled
    by MxCore::setMoveScale(). While movement scaling is sufficient for small demos, it's
    often insufficient to move at a specified rate. Consider using setLeftStick(float,float,double)
    instead. See also setStickRate() and setStickRates().

    Behavior is identical to that of setLeftStick(float,float), except that \c x and \c y
    values are taken as normalized percentages in the range -1.0 to 1.0 of a desired
    movement rate in units/second. The movement rate for the left stick is set with
    setStickRate() (see also setStickRates()).
    
    \param deltaSeconds Specifies the elapsed time in seconds since the last call to
    setLeftStick(float,float,double). This function computes the delta motion based on
    \c _leftRate and \c deltaSeconds, then scales that motion by \c x and \c y. */

    Right stick controls rotation. The x value rotates around the current
    view up vector. The y value rotates around the "right" vector (the
    cross product of the view direction and view up vector).

    Positive values rotate counterclockwise. For example, if the MxCore
    class is being used to manage a view matrix, and setRightStick is called
    with a positive x value, this rotates the view counterclockwise around
    the up vector, resulting in "turning your head left". In the same situation,
    a positive y value "looks up".

    /** Set the stick dead zone.

    Specify a non-zero dead zone to eliminate non-zero values from

    Both setLeftStick() and setRightStick() check their input parameters
    against the specified dead zone value. If the absolute value of
    a parameter is less that \c dz, the value is zeroed. The default
    dead zone value is 0.0.

    Most game pad sticks produce non-zero values for sticks that are
    actually idle. Call setStickDeadZone() to eliminate this issue.

    As an example usage, where setLeftStick and setRightStick are called
    with \c x and \c y values in the range -1 to 1, a \c dz dead zone value
    of 0.05 would mean that 5% around the stick center position would be
