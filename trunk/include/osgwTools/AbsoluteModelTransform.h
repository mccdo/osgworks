\section IntroSection Introduction

osgWorks is an open source SDK intended for OSG developers.
The project contains developer tools that are useful to developers
of most OSG software, such as standalone applications,
transformation utilities, visitors, custom nodes, scene graph
editing facilities, basic geometric shapes, plugins, test models,
and example programs.

\section LibrariesSection Libraries

\subsection osgwTools osgwTools

The primary osgWorks library, osgwTools, contains a large collection of
OSG-based NodeVisitors, custom Nodes, utility functions, and other useful tools.

\subsection osgwControls osgwControls

osgwControls is a partially implemented 3D UI toolkit.

\subsection osgwMx osgwMx

osgwMx contains matrix support routines, including a flexible viewing manipulator
and event handler that supports variable FOV and toggling between perspective and
orthographic projections.

\subsection osgwQuery osgwQuery

osgwQuery contains OpenGL occlusion query support utilities, including an implementation
of the Guthe optimal occlusion query algorithm.

/** \class AbsoluteModelTransform AbsoluteModelTransform.h <osgwTools/AbsoluteModelTransform.h>
\brief Sets the model part of the OpenGL modelview matrix.

AbsoluteModelTransform (AMT) is an OSG Transform that overloads ABSOLUTE_RF to
preserve the view. Non-Camera transforms above this Node in the hierarchy are
ignored, and the matrix stored in this Node is the only transform concatenated
with the view.

This is useful, for example, when allowing a 3rd party physics simultator to
transform parts of your scene graph without reparenting those parts to the
scene graph root. In fact, this class was created to support the osgBullet
project (osgBullet.googlecode.com).

You can disable this behavior by setting the reference frame to RELATIVE_RF,
which causes this Transform to behave like a regular MatrixTransform. The
default reference frame is ABSOLUTE_RF.

For the AbsoluteModelTransform to operate, it needs the current view matrix.
The code supports obtaining the view matrix in two ways. Select the algorithm
using the OSGWORKS_SCENEVIEW_ANAGLYPHIC_STEREO_SUPPORT CMake variable. By default,
OSGWORKS_SCENEVIEW_ANAGLYPHIC_STEREO_SUPPORT is disabled, and AbsoluteModelTransform
assumes there is a Camera in the CullVisitor NodePath that contains the view matrix.
This is the most efficient method, but it doesn't work in some usages, such
as when the user has enabled anaglyphic stereo via the OSG_STEREO environment variable.
Set OSGWORKS_SCENEVIEW_ANAGLYPHIC_STEREO_SUPPORT on in CMake to support this usage. When
enabled, AbsoluteModelTransform obtains the view matrix by accumulating the model transform
from the NodePath, inverting it, and multiplying it by the CullVisitor current modelview
matrix. The result is the view transform. This is a more general purpose, but less efficient solution.
