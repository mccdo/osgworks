#summary What to do after it's built

= Using osgwwhich =

*osgwwhich* uses the same search algorithm employed by OSG to find data files and shared libraries, and then displays the full path of the specified file. This is useful when you have multiple data files with the same name, as *osgwwhich* tells you the location of the file that OSG would load. It's also useful when you have multiple copies of OSG installed on your system, as osgwwhich tells you the path to the OSG library or plugin.

For example, the following command shows where OSG will find "cow.osg" (a part of the OpenSceneGraph-Data sample data set):
{{{
C:\Users\pmartz>osgwwhich cow.osg
C:\Projects\OSG\OSG-Data\cow.osg
}}}

Note that this works with the OSG notify level. If you wanted to see all the locations that OSG searches before it finds your data file, set the OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL accordingly.
{{{
C:\Users\pmartz>set OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL=DEBUG

C:\Users\pmartz>osgwwhich tetra.osg
itr='C:\Projects\OSG\OSG-Data'
FindFileInPath() : trying C:\Projects\OSG\OSG-Data\tetra.osg ...
itr='C:\Projects\Physics\osgBullet\data'
FindFileInPath() : trying C:\Projects\Physics\osgBullet\data\tetra.osg ...
FindFileInPath() : USING C:\Projects\Physics\osgBullet\data\tetra.osg
C:\Projects\Physics\osgBullet\data\tetra.osg
}}}

The following command locates the OSG OpenFlight plugin:
{{{
C:\Users\pmartz>osgwwhich osgdb_openflight.dll
C:\Program Files\OpenSceneGraph\bin\osgPlugins-2.8.2\osgdb_openflight.dll
}}}

The following command displays the osgWorks version number, and also locates the osgUtil library:
{{{
C:\Users\pmartz>osgwwhich -v osg55-osgUtil.dll
osgWorks version 1.0.0 (10000).

C:\Program Files\OpenSceneGraph\bin\osg55-osgUtil.dll
}}}

== Future work ==

As currently implemented, *osgwwhich* is great for locating data files. In order to find a library, you must know the library name format, or even the shared object version number, which makes *osgwwhich* somewhat less useful for locating libraries. In the future, *osgwwhich* will drop the requirement for the full library name, so that you will be able to do:
{{{
C:\Users\pmartz>osgwwhich flt
C:\Program Files\OpenSceneGraph\bin\osgPlugins-2.8.2\osgdb_openflight.dll
}}}

And also:
{{{
C:\Users\pmartz>osgwwhich osgUtil
C:\Program Files\OpenSceneGraph\bin\osg55-osgUtil.dll
}}}
