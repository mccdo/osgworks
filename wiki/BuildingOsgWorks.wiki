= Dependencies =

osgWorks depends on !OpenSceneGraph. See the CompatibilityMatrix.

The osgWorks build system requires CMake v2.6.4 or later.

= Building =

Like !OpenSceneGraph, osgWorks uses CMake. To create project files for osgWorks, follow these general steps:
  * Run the CMake GUI or ccmake.
  * Specify a build directory, then select Configure.
  * Click the Configure button a second time (all variables must be clear, not red).
  * Click the Generate button.

Use your project files / makefiles to build osgWorks. Build the install target to install osgWorks on your system.

= Finding OSG =

The CMake system that comes with osgWorks is designed to automatically find OSG if it's installed on your system in a standard/typical location. If the CMake system fails to find OSG, it's usually for one of two reasons. Either you have OSG installed in a non-standard location, or you'd like to use OSG from a source tree.

If you have OSG installed in a non-standard location, specify the top-level install directory with the OSG_ROOT variable (either in the environment, or in CMake). Then select Configure again.

If you are using OSG from a source tree, use the OSG_BUILD_DIR and OSG_SOURCE_DIR variables (either in the environment, or in CMake) to specify the root of the build and source trees, respectively. Then select Configure again.

In summary:
  * If OSG is in a standard location, you shouldn't need to set any variables. CMake should just find it.
  * Set *either* OSG_ROOT (if installed in a non-standard location) *or both* OSG_BUILD_DIR/OSG_SOURCE_DIR (if using OSG from a source tree). You should never have to set all three.

= Installing osgWorks =

Once you have built osgWorks it is possible to install osgWorks into a directory that will contain a bin, lib, and include directory with the 'install' target for GNUMake. The location of this directory can be set via the CMake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. After you have installed osgWorks, be sure to point your (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH at the lib directory and your PATH at the bin directory. This will enable your applications to load the appropriate osgWorks libraries and plugins.
