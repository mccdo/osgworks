#summary How to build.

= Dependencies =

osgWorks depends on !OpenSceneGraph. Compatible versions of OSG include v2.8.1, v2.8.2, and current svn head as of September 2009.

= Building =

Like !OpenSceneGraph, osgWorks uses CMake. To create project files for osgWorks, follow these general steps:
  * Run the CMake GUI or ccmake.
  * Specify a build directory, then hit Configure.
  * Hit Configure a second time (all variables must be clear, not red).
  * Hit Generate.

Use your project files / makefiles to build osgWorks. Build the install target to install osgWorks on your system.

= Finding OSG =

The CMake system that comes with osgWorks is designed to automatically find OSG if it's installed on your system in a standard/typical location. If the CMake system fails to find OSG, it's usually for one of two reasons. Either you have OSG installed in a non-standard location, or you'd like to use OSG from a source tree.

If you have OSG installed in a non-standard location, specify the top-level install directory with the OSG_ROOT variable (either in the environment, or in CMake). Then select Configure again.

If you are using OSG from a source tree, use the OSG_BUILD_DIR and OSG_SOURCE_DIR variables (either in the environment, or in CMake) to specify the root of the builf and source trees, respectively. Then select Configure again.

In summart:
  * If OSG is in a standard location, you shouldn't need to set any variables. CMake should just find it.
  * Set *either* OSG_ROOT (if installed in a non-standard location) *or both* OSG_BUILD_DIR/OSG_SOURCE_DIR (if using OSG from a source tree). You should never have to set all three.
