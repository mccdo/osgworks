osgwnames displays the structure of a scene graph in human-readable form. It displays a summary of the hierarchy using indentation with each node represented as a single line of text, containing the class and Node name. If the Node name is empty, _NULL_ displays in its place.

= Simple Usage =

Try running osgwnames on `dectest20.osg`, one of the osgWorks data files:

*C:\Projects>osgwnames dectest20.ive*
*world (Group)*
*  door_assembly.asm.2 (Group)*
*    NULL (MatrixTransform)*
*      KNOB.PRT (Geode)*
*    NULL (MatrixTransform)*
*      KNOB.PRT **#2 (Geode)*
***    NULL (MatrixTransform)*
*      DOOR.PRT (Geode)*
*    POLE.PRT (Geode)*


The output shows the scene graph hierarchical structure: 
 * The scene graph has a top-level Group node named _world_, has a single Group child named _door_assembly.asm.2_.
 * _door_assembly.asm.2_ has four children, three of which are unnamed MatrixTransform objects (the name is displayed as _NULL_), and the fourth child is a Geode named _POLE.PRT_.
 * Each of the MatrixTransform objects have Geode children, with names _KNOB.PRT_, _KNOB.PRT #2_, and _DOOR.PRT_.
To produce more readable output, you can prevent the display of Geodes with the *--nogeodes* option:

*C:\Projects>osgwnames --nogeodes dectest20.ive*
*world (Group)*
*  door_assembly.asm.2 (Group)*
*    NULL (MatrixTransform)*
*    NULL (MatrixTransform)*
*    NULL (MatrixTransform)*
