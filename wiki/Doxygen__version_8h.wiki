  osgWorks version number as an integer.
  C preprocessor integrated version number. The form is Mmmss, where: 
 * M is the major version
 * mm is the minor version (zero-padded)
 * ss is the sub version (zero padded)
Use this in version-specific code, for example: 
*   #if( OSGWORKS_VERSION < 10500 )*
***      ... code specific to releases before v1.05*
*   #endif*

*Returns*:
  And a return value!

{{{
#void OSGWORKS_OSG_VERSION   (
  )
}}}
  OSG version number as an integer.
  This macro provides the same functionality as OSGWORKS_VERSION, but instead encodes the OSG version number as an integer. OSG did not provide a useful compile-time version comparison macro until after the 2.9.6 and 2.8.2 releases.

*Returns*:
