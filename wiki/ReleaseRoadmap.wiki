#summary Plans for upcoming osgWorks releases

<wiki:toc />

= v2.1 =
*Status:* Ongoing development on svn trunk.

This release will introduce the new osgwMx library containing support for matrix and view manipulation, a game pad device (via DirectInput), and a space ball device (via VRPN).


= v2.0 =

*Released 26 Oct 2011*

This release is not backwards-compatible with osgWorks v1.xx-based applications.

 * Compatibility with osgBullet v2.0.

 * Deprecated functionality, such as the *Grid* class, has been removed.

= v1.1 =

*Released 11 Sept 2010*

 * *Shapes* - This release adds several convenience routines for creating basic shapes such as boxes, circles, planes, spheres, and arrows. These are intended to be osg::Geometry-based alternatives to using osg::!ShapeDrawable. !ShapeDrawable preserves meta data about the shape, but the *osgWorks* variants provide direct access to vertex data and are more likely to be supported by OSG plugins and third party OSG-based libraries. Shapes support for drawing planes deprecates the Grid class.

 * *RemoveLOD* - A visitor to disable LOD nodes by rendering only the highest LOD child.

 * *Build fixes* - This release contains build fixes for a number of platforms.

= v1.0 =
