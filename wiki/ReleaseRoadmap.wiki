#summary Plans for upcoming osgWorks releases

<wiki:toc />

= v2.0 =

*Release date:* June-July 2010

*Status:* Not yet started.

 * *osgBullet compatibility* - v2.0 will probably contain some support for the upcoming *osgBullet* v2.0.

 * *Remove Grid* - v2.0 will remove the deprecated Grid class and Grid.cpp/.h.

= v1.1 =

*Release date:* April-May 2010

*Status:* Release candidate available. Development is on the 1.1 branch.

 * *Shapes* - This release adds several convenience routines for creating basic shapes such as boxes, circles, planes, spheres, and arrows. These are intended to be osg::Geometry-based alternatives to using osg::!ShapeDrawable. !ShapeDrawable preserves meta data about the shape, but the *osgWorks* variants provide direct access to vertex data and are more likely to be supported by OSG plugins and third party OSG-based libraries. Shapes support for drawing planes deprecates the Grid class.

 * *Build fixes* - This release contains build fixes for a number of platforms.

= v1.0 =
